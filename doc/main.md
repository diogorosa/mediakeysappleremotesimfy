Media Keys and Apple Remote Support for simfy.de
================================================

This is a restartless Firefox extension that lets you pause / resume playback on [www.simfy.de](http://www.simfy.de/) using the media keys on Apple keyboards and using the Apple Remote. It can be installed by dragging the file ```mediakeysappleremotesimfy.xpi``` into Firefox.

It's compatible with Firefox 13 or higher on Mac OS X.

Playing the next / previous song isn't possible at the moment because the Flash player widget on simfy.de doesn't expose the necessary methods.

Exclusive access to the media keys and to the Apple Remote is held while at least one simfy tab is open. Close all simfy tabs in order to be able to control iTunes (or anything else) again.
